# Open the CSV file for reading:

csvFile = open(r"<PathToYourOldCSVFileWithSingleBackSlashes>","r")

# Create the new output CSV file and open it for writing:

newCSVFile = open(r"<PathToANewNonexistentOrEmptyCSVFileWithSingleBackSlashes>", "w+")

# Read the lines. This splits the rows up into a list and transposes the values into new lines in the new CSV.
# The following lines:
# - Pull out the extra enter at the end of the line
# - Split the row into a list, using commas as the delineation since it's a CSV.
# - Starts an x/y variable that swaps to indicate whether the inserted line should be followed by a comma or a line break
# - Inserts the new lines into the new CSV

csvFile.close()
